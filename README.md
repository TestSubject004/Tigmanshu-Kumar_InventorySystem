inventory system for the AutoVRse test

I am unable to add all my project files here due to git's data limit. As such, I have created a private google drive  link and uploaded the project there.
here's the link.

UPDATE - so, I got the git LFS system working correctly with the proper settings and now the project code files are available directly from this github repo. Download the .rar file and extract it.
